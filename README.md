I am very busy and unfamiliar with writing in markdown as of now. Apologies but GoogleDocs was just the easiest method of making sure this document was available and commentable.

Thanks for feedback and I will learn to use ScholarMarkdown and other fancier methods of paper composition in the coming weeks and months, promise hahaha.
