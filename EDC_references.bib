As a proof of concept, we reported a comprehensive analysis of the privacy risks in clinical proteomic data. It showed that a small number of peptides carrying the minor alleles (referred to as the minor allelic peptides) at non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism ({nsSNP}) sites can be identified in typical clinical proteomic datasets acquired from the blood/serum samples of individual patient, from which the patient can be identified with high confidence. Our results suggested the presence of significant privacy risks in raw clinical proteomic data. However, these risks can be mitigated by a straightforward pre-processing step of the raw data that removing a very small fraction (0.1\%, 7.14 out of 7,504 spectra on average) of {MS}/{MS} spectra identified as the minor allelic peptides, which has little or no impact on the subsequent analysis (and re-use) of these datasets.},

	abstract = {Summary
Here, we present a highly efficient R-package seqminer2 for querying and retrieving sequence variants from biobank scale datasets of millions of individuals and hundreds of millions of genetic variants. Seqminer2 implements a novel variant-based index for querying {VCF}/{BCF} files. It improves the speed of query and retrieval by several magnitudes compared to the state-of-the-art tools based upon tabix. It also reimplements support for {BGEN} and {PLINK} format, which improves speed over alternative implementations. The improved efficiency and comprehensive support for popular file formats will facilitate method development, software prototyping and data analysis of biobank scale sequence datasets in R.

Availability and implementation
The seqminer2 R package is available from https://github.com/zhanxw/seqminer. Scripts used for the benchmarks are available in https://github.com/yang-lina/seqminer/blob/master/seqminer2\%20benchmark\%20script.txt.

Supplementary information

	abstract = {Ongoing health challenges, such as the increased global burden of chronic disease, are increasingly answered by calls for personalized approaches to healthcare. Genomic medicine, a vital component of these personalization strategies, is applied in risk assessment, prevention, prognostication, and therapeutic targeting. However, several practical, ethical, and technological challenges remain. Across Europe, Personal Health Data Space ({PHDS}) projects are under development aiming to establish patient-centered, interoperable data ecosystems balancing data access, control, and use for individual citizens to complement the research and commercial focus of the European Health Data Space provisions. The current study explores healthcare users’ and health care professionals’ perspectives on personalized genomic medicine and {PHDS} solutions, in casu the Personal Genetic Locker ({PGL}). A mixed-methods design was used, including surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Several meta-themes were generated from the data: (i) participants were interested in genomic information; (ii) participants valued data control, robust infrastructure, and sharing data with non-commercial stakeholders; (iii) autonomy was a central concern for all participants; (iv) institutional and interpersonal trust were highly significant for genomic medicine; and (v) participants encouraged the implementation of {PHDSs} since {PHDSs} were thought to promote the use of genomic data and enhance patients’ control over their data. To conclude, we formulated several facilitators to implement genomic medicine in healthcare based on the perspectives of a diverse set of stakeholders.},

However, because it excludes a great deal of common human variation, it introduces a pervasive reference bias into the field of human genomics. To reduce this bias, it makes sense to draw on representative collections of human genomes, brought together into reference cohorts. There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph-based models. Here, we survey various projects underway to build and apply these graph-based structures—which we collectively refer to as genome graphs—and discuss the improvements in read mapping, variant calling, and haplotype determination that genome graphs are expected to produce.},

In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Background: Adoption of a common data model across health systems is a key infrastructure requirement to allow large scale distributed comparative effectiveness analyses. There are a growing number of common data models ({CDM}), such as Mini-Sentinel, and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ({OMOP}) {CDMs}.
            Objective: In this case study, we describe the challenges and opportunities of a study specific use of the {OMOP} {CDM} by two health systems and describe three comparative effectiveness use cases developed from the {CDM}.
            Methods: The project transformed two health system databases (using crosswalks provided) into the {OMOP} {CDM}. Cohorts were developed from the transformed {CDMs} for three comparative effectiveness use case examples. Administrative/billing, demographic, order history, medication, and laboratory were included in the {CDM} transformation and cohort development rules.
            Results: Record counts per person month are presented for the eligible cohorts, highlighting differences between the civilian and federal datasets, e.g. the federal data set had more outpatient visits per person month (6.44 vs. 2.05 per person month). The count of medications per person month reflected the fact that one system‘s medications were extracted from orders while the other system had pharmacy fills and medication administration records. The federal system also had a higher prevalence of the conditions in all three use cases. Both systems required manual coding of some types of data to convert to the {CDM}.
            Conclusion: The data transformation to the {CDM} was time consuming and resources required were substantial, beyond requirements for collecting native source data. The need to manually code subsets of data limited the conversion. However, once the native data was converted to the {CDM}, both systems were then able to use the same queries to identify cohorts. Thus, the {CDM} minimized the effort to develop cohorts and analyze the results across the sites.

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized rare disease diagnostics, but many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis, particularly because many candidate variants usually survive despite strict filtering. Exomiser was launched in 2014 as a Java tool that performs an integrative analysis of patients’ sequencing data and their phenotypes encoded with Human Phenotype Ontology ({HPO}) terms. It prioritizes variants by leveraging information on variant frequency, predicted pathogenicity, and gene-phenotype associations derived from human diseases, model organisms, and protein–protein interactions. Early published releases of Exomiser were able to prioritize disease-causative variants as top candidates in up to 97\% of simulated whole-exomes. The size of the tested real patient datasets published so far are very limited. Here, we present the latest Exomiser version 12.0.1 with many new features. We assessed the performance using a set of 134 whole-exomes from patients with a range of rare retinal diseases and known molecular diagnosis. Using default settings, Exomiser ranked the correct diagnosed variants as the top candidate in 74\% of the dataset and top 5 in 94\%; not using the patients’ {HPO} profiles (i.e., variant-only analysis) decreased the performance to 3\% and 27\%, respectively. In conclusion, Exomiser is an effective support tool for rare Mendelian phenotype-driven variant prioritization.},

	abstract = {Background
              Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources ({FHIR})-based electronic health records ({EHRs}). In addition, {FHIR} is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain.
            
            
              Objective
              The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to {FHIR}, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future {FHIR} applications.
            
            
              Methods
              In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including {ACM}, {IEEE} Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, {PubMed}, and {ScienceDirect}. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration.
            
            
              Results
              The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of {FHIR}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of {FHIR} in the health care domain in the near future.},

With the development of various bioinformatics applications, maintaining the productivity of research, managing human genome data, and analyzing downstream data is essential. This review aims to guide struggling researchers to process and analyze these large-scale genomic data to extract relevant information for improved downstream analyses. Here, we discuss worldwide human genome projects that could be integrated into any data for improved analysis. Obtaining human whole-genome sequencing data from both data stores and processes is costly; therefore, we focus on the development of data format and software that manipulate whole-genome sequencing. Once the sequencing is complete and its format and data processing tools are selected, a computational platform is required. For the platform, we describe a multi-cloud strategy that balances between cost, performance, and customizability. A good quality published research relies on data reproducibility to ensure quality results, reusability for applications to other datasets, as well as scalability for the future increase of datasets. To solve these, we describe several key technologies developed in computer science, including workflow engine. We also discuss the ethical guidelines inevitable for human genomic data analysis that differ from model organisms. Finally, the future ideal perspective of data processing and analysis is summarized.},

There is great desire to share these data. However, privacy concerns often preclude sharing of the raw reads. To enable safe sharing, aggregated summaries such as read-depth signal profiles and levels of gene expression are used. Projects such as {GTEx} and {ENCODE} share these because they ostensibly do not leak much identifying information. Here, we attempt to quantify the validity of this statement, measuring the leakage of genomic deletions from signal profiles. We present information theoretic measures for the degree to which one can genotype these deletions. We then develop practical genotyping approaches and demonstrate how to use these to identify an individual within a large cohort in the context of linking attacks. Finally, we present an anonymization method removing much of the leakage from signal profiles.},

              The scoping review has become an increasingly popular approach for synthesizing research evidence. It is a relatively new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the literature.
            
            
              Methods
              A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms.
            
            
              Results
              The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from 1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three‐quarter of reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times varied from 2 weeks to 20 months, and 51\% utilized a published methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies was infrequently performed (22.38\%).
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Scoping reviews are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a need for their methodological standardization to ensure the utility and strength of evidence. © 2014 The Authors.

In the complex legislative environment of the European Union, genomic data sharing policies will have to weigh the benefits of scientific discovery against the ethical risks posed by the act of sharing sensitive data. In this complex, interconnected environment, blockchain provides a unique and novel solution to accountability, traceability, and transparency issues regarding genomic data sharing. Implementing a distributed ledger technology-based database could empower both patients and citizens to responsibly use genomic data pertaining to them because it allows for a higher degree of control over the recipients of their data and their uses. The blockchain technology will engage both data owners and policymakers to address the multiple issues of genomic data sharing and allow us to redefine the way we look at genomics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Objective
              Enabling clinicians to formulate individualized clinical management strategies from the sea of molecular data remains a fundamentally important but daunting task. Here, we describe efforts towards a new paradigm in genomics-electronic health record ({HER}) integration, using a standardized suite of {FHIR} Genomics Operations that encapsulates the complexity of molecular data so that precision medicine solution developers can focus on building applications.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              {FHIR} Genomics Operations essentially “wrap” a genomics data repository, presenting a uniform interface to applications. More importantly, operations encapsulate the complexity of data within a repository and normalize redundant data representations—particularly relevant in genomics, where a tremendous amount of raw data exists in often-complex non-{FHIR} formats.
            
            
              Results
              Fifteen {FHIR} Genomics Operations have been developed, designed to support a wide range of clinical scenarios, such as variant discovery; clinical trial matching; hereditary condition and pharmacogenomic screening; and variant reanalysis. Operations are being matured through the {HL}7 balloting process, connectathons, pilots, and the {HL}7 {FHIR} Accelerator program.
            
            
              Discussion
              Next-generation sequencing can identify thousands to millions of variants, whose clinical significance can change over time as our knowledge evolves. To manage such a large volume of dynamic and complex data, new models of genomics-{EHR} integration are needed. Qualitative observations to date suggest that freeing application developers from the need to understand the nuances of genomic data, and instead base applications on standardized {APIs} can not only accelerate integration but also dramatically expand the applications of Omic data in driving precision care at scale for all.},

In order to support (international) medical research with the combination of genomic and clinical patient data, a standardization and harmonization of these data sources is highly desirable. To support this increasing importance of genomic data, we have created semantic mapping from raw genomic data to both {FHIR} (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and {OMOP} (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) {CDM} (Common Data Model) and analyzed the data coverage of both models. For this, we calculated the mapping score for different data categories and the relative data coverage in both {FHIR} and {OMOP} {CDM}. Our results show, that the patients genomic data can be mapped to {OMOP} {CDM} directly from {VCF} (Variant Call Format) file with a coverage of slightly over 50\%. However, using {FHIR} as intermediate representation does not lead to further information loss as the already stored data in {FHIR} can be further transformed into {OMOP} {CDM} format with almost 100\% success. Our findings are in favor of extending {OMOP} {CDM} with patient genomic data using {ETL} to enable the researchers to apply different analysis methods including machine learning algorithms on genomic data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In 2016, guidelines for diagnostic Next Generation Sequencing ({NGS}) have been published by {EuroGentest} in order to assist laboratories in the implementation and accreditation of {NGS} in a diagnostic setting. These guidelines mainly focused on Whole Exome Sequencing ({WES}) and targeted (gene panels) sequencing detecting small germline variants (Single Nucleotide Variants ({SNVs}) and insertions/deletions (indels)). Since then, Whole Genome Sequencing ({WGS}) has been increasingly introduced in the diagnosis of rare diseases as {WGS} allows the simultaneous detection of {SNVs}, Structural Variants ({SVs}) and other types of variants such as repeat expansions. The use of {WGS} in diagnostics warrants the re-evaluation and update of previously published guidelines. This work was jointly initiated by {EuroGentest} and the Horizon2020 project Solve-{RD}. Statements from the 2016 guidelines have been reviewed in the context of {WGS} and updated where necessary. The aim of these recommendations is primarily to list the points to consider for clinical (laboratory) geneticists, bioinformaticians, and (non-)geneticists, to provide technical advice, aid clinical decision-making and the reporting of the results.},

	abstract = {Background
              Personal electronic health records ({PEHRs}) allow patients to view, generate, and manage their personal and medical data that are relevant across illness episodes, such as their medications, allergies, immunizations, and their medical, social, and family health history. Thus, patients can actively participate in the management of their health care by ensuring that their health care providers have an updated and accurate overview of the patients’ medical records. However, the uptake of {PEHRs} remains low, especially in terms of patients entering and managing their personal and medical data in their {PEHR}.
            
            
              Objective
              This scoping review aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators that patients face when deciding to review, enter, update, or modify their personal and medical data in their {PEHR}. This review also explores the extent to which patient-generated and -managed data affect the quality and safety of care, patient engagement, patient satisfaction, and patients’ health and health care services.
            
            
              Methods
              We searched the {MEDLINE}, Embase, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO}, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar web-based databases, as well as reference lists of all primary and review articles using a predefined search query.
            
            
              Results
              Of the 182 eligible papers, 37 (20\%) provided sufficient information about patients’ data management activities. The results showed that patients tend to use their {PEHRs} passively rather than actively. Patients refrain from generating and managing their medical data in a {PEHR}, especially when these data are complex and sensitive. The reasons for patients’ passive data management behavior were related to their concerns about the validity, applicability, and confidentiality of patient-generated data. Our synthesis also showed that patient-generated and -managed health data ensures that the medical record is complete and up to date and is positively associated with patient engagement and patient satisfaction.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The findings of this study suggest recommendations for implementing design features within the {PEHR} and the construal of a dedicated policy to inform both clinical staff and patients about the added value of patient-generated data. Moreover, clinicians should be involved as important ambassadors in informing, reminding, and encouraging patients to manage the data in their {PEHR}.},

We generated deep, whole-genome sequence data of 17 individuals in a three-generation pedigree and called variants in each genome using a range of currently available algorithms. We used haplotype transmission information to create a phased “Platinum” variant catalog of 4.7 million single-nucleotide variants ({SNVs}) plus 0.7 million small (1–50 bp) insertions and deletions (indels) that are consistent with the pattern of inheritance in the parents and 11 children of this pedigree. Platinum genotypes are highly concordant with the current catalog of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for both {SNVs} ({\textgreater}99.99\%) and indels (99.92\%) and add a validated truth catalog that has 26\% more {SNVs} and 45\% more indels. Analysis of 334,652 {SNVs} that were consistent between informatics pipelines yet inconsistent with haplotype transmission (“nonplatinum”) revealed that the majority of these variants are de novo and cell-line mutations or reside within previously unidentified duplications and deletions. The reference materials from this study are a resource for objective assessment of the accuracy of variant calls throughout genomes.},

            Rare diseases affect 30 million people in the {USA} and more than 300–400 million worldwide, often causing chronic illness, disability, and premature death. Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on heuristic approaches, coupling clinical experience from prior rare disease presentations with the medical literature. A large number of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed for years and many even die without an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, gene panels, microarrays, and exome sequencing have helped to identify the molecular cause of such rare and undiagnosed diseases. These technologies have allowed diagnoses for a sizable proportion (25–35\%) of undiagnosed patients, often with actionable findings. However, a large proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed. In this review, we focus on technologies that can be adopted if exome sequencing is unrevealing. We discuss the benefits of sequencing the whole genome and the additional benefit that may be offered by long-read technology, pan-genome reference, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and methyl profiling. We highlight computational methods to help identify regionally distant patients with similar phenotypes or similar genetic mutations. Finally, we describe approaches to automate and accelerate genomic analysis. The strategies discussed here are intended to serve as a guide for clinicians and researchers in the next steps when encountering patients with non-diagnostic exomes.},

	abstract = {As {RDF} becomes more widely established and the amount of linked data is rapidly increasing, the efficient querying of large amount of data becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a family of algorithms for querying large amount of linked data in a distributed manner. These query evaluation algorithms are independent of the way the data is stored, as well as of the particular implementation of the query evaluation. We then use the {MapReduce} paradigm to present a distributed implementation of these algorithms and experimentally evaluate them, although the algorithms could be straightforwardly translated into other distributed processing frameworks. We also investigate and propose multiple query decomposition approaches of Basic Graph Patterns (subclass of {SPARQL} queries) that are used to improve the overall performance of the distributed query answering. A deep analysis of the effectiveness of these decomposition algorithms is also provided.},

The growth in acceptance of {RDF} format can be attributed to its flexible and reusable nature. The size of {RDF} data is steadily increasing as many government organizations and companies are using {RDF} for data representation and exchange. This resulted in the need for developing distributed {RDF} frameworks that can efficiently manage {RDF} data on large scale i.e. Big {RDF} data. These scalable distributed {RDF} data management systems competent enough to handle Big {RDF} data can also be termed as Big {RDF} frameworks. The proliferation of {RDF} data has made {RDF} data management a difficult task. In this survey, we provide an extensive literature on Big {RDF} frameworks from the aspect of storage, partitioning, indexing, query optimization and processing. A taxonomy of the tools and technologies used for storage and retrieval of Big {RDF} data in these systems has been presented. The comparative evaluation of some Big {RDF} frameworks based on query performance and our observations from this evaluation are described. The research challenges identified during the study of these systems are elaborated to suggest promising directions for future research.},
